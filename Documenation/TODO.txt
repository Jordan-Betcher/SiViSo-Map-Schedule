		[x] Error: Map Blank
			The Solution was I was using the API key of a previous google map project and it was restricted so I had to add the package name and "SHA-1 certificate fingerprint" found in google_maps_api.xml to the key
			Note: this is why it was working in the first project but not the next, couldn't find help because the tutorials just click the create new button
