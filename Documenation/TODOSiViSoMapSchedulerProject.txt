[x]Bugs
    [x] ListView not Scrolling
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7210756/why-is-my-listview-not-scrolling
    [x] When inputting to form, done doesn't close keyboard
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24793045/how-to-have-an-edittext-element-deselect-itself-when-enter-is-pressed
    [?] When inputting to form clicking off doesn't deselect
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4828636/edittext-clear-focus-on-touch-outside
    [x] Clear form on cancel
    [x] ListView not selectable
        You have to set focusablity to false for all item parts (textview, button, spinner, etc...) in the adapter class getView method(This will make it so that if a part of the item is not selectable / doesn't have an onclick function then it will call the listview onclicklistener. If it is selectable and isn't focusable it will still select the item)

    []  Need to seperate out the different activity windows instead of having states in the code (this also allows the triangle back button to work because it navigates to previous activities)
        Seperate out the google map into a fragment and then use the fragment so that you don't have to reload the map each time https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46932430/how-to-use-single-google-map-for-multiple-activities
