    [x] ListView not selectable
        You have to set focusablity to false for all item parts (textview, button, spinner, etc...) in the adapter class getView method(This will make it so that if a part of the item is not selectable / doesn't have an onclick function then it will call the listview onclicklistener. If it is selectable and isn't focusable it will still select the item)
