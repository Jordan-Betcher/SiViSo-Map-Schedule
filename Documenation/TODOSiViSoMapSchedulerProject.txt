    Description
        Have you ever been annoyed at having to remember to silence your phone?
        
        About
            When I was a college student I wished that my phone would default to silence. Or when I went to church, the library, etc... There are scheduling apps, one is even built into the phone, but sometimes I would go over / under schedule.
        
        Recommend
        - Notification Reminder
            An app that reminds you about missed notifcations. It works with Siviso because once siviso goes to sound the notifcations will tell you if you missed anything.
Learn how updates work (I think you just upload new apk)

Optional:
Change Siviso from switch (words) to siviso icons
? indicate current mode (i.e. Current location color change depending on current do not disturb mode)
? Siviso Circle highlights when current location is in it.
[]Settings (Do I need these now?)
    []Radius (SivisoLite only has 1 area, were siviso this would be default but idividually editable
    []Zoom
    Make the option to have current ringtone match the default sivso when not colliding
    x Make sound / vibrate when eatering sound if have notification (instead recommend install notification reminder)
    ? Mute "other media" volume as well (instead tell that it depends on do not disturb settings)
    ? Improve battery use with these settings
        by asking less (rate at which it checks the location) (i.e. once a minute)
        by increasing min distance move before checking
    ? Quiets all instead of changing do not distrub (change "other" volume as well)
    ? Override manual / other app changes by constantly changing based on asking rate
? Change Default to Exit or OnExit
Add max volume option
Make sound's volume adjustable
Make the siviso circle have no fill but instead have thicker lines
Create a company when make enough to warrent it

    [x] ListView not selectable
        You have to set focusablity to false for all item parts (textview, button, spinner, etc...) in the adapter class getView method(This will make it so that if a part of the item is not selectable / doesn't have an onclick function then it will call the listview onclicklistener. If it is selectable and isn't focusable it will still select the item)
